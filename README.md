# Camera-App
Basic Windows Form camera app written in c#
This trial was mainly used to help me understand how to communicate with a camera using code.
I wanted to figure out how to work with this tech so I can apply it to a project I am working on that uses Windows IOT.
I used the Aforge library to communicate with the camera. And used the combobox to be able to pick up possible input devices(cameras).
I used a simple form to try out these functionalities such as buttons, combo boxes and a picture box.
